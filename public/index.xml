      <description>Objective and MotivationMy goal for this document is to teach the basic principles of conducting a Bayesian analysis of diagnostic data in JAGS (“Just Another Gibbs Sampler”). I am assuming a basic knowledge of Bayesian ideas, such as the definition of a prior, posterior, and likelihood. I will also not be explaining the concept of a Gibbs sampler (for that I recommend John Kruschke’s islands example). Rather, I’ll focus on creating a user-friendly document showing how to implement these ideas.</description>
