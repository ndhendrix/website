abstract: 'Background<br><br>
Health state utility values (HSUVs) are among the most influential attributes of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). Our objective was to evaluate whether industry-funded studies select systematically different HSUVs as compared with studies without industry funding.<br><br>

Methods<br><br>
Among 10 diseases with high disease burden in the United States, we further identified 31 progressive health states. We then searched the Tufts Medical Centerâ€™s CEA Registry to identify studies that included HSUVs and were submitted to the registry between 2002 and 2019. Two reviewers mapped the free-text descriptions of health states onto the 31 predefined health states. We analyzed the effect of industry funding on the point estimates of these HSUVs with a beta regression. We also analyzed the difference between related health states within studies by funding source with a linear regression.<br><br>

Results<br><br>
After identifying 26,222 HSUVs from 4198 CEAs, we matched 2573 HSUVs to the 31 predefined health states. We observed large variations within each health state: 12 of 31 health states included a range of HSUVs greater than 0.5. The point estimate model showed 1 statistically significant difference of 31 comparisons between studies with any industry funding and those without. The utility difference model found 3 significant differences out of 39 comparisons between CEAs with any industry funding and those without.<br><br>

Limitations<br><br>
Inclusion of unpublished CEAs may have affected our conclusions about the effect of industry funding on selection of HSUVs. We also relied on free-text descriptions of health states available in the CEA Registry and did not include adjustment for multiple comparisons.<br><br>

Conclusion<br><br>
Limited evidence exists that industry-funded studies select different HSUVs compared to non-industry-funded studies for the health states we considered.'

summary: There are often multiple utility weights available for a given health state, which creates the opportunity for researchers to select utility weights that bias the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis towards their product. We use a regression-based approach to utility weights reported in Tufts Medical Center's Cost-Effectiveness Registry to determine whether industry-sponsored cost-effectiveness analyses use systematically different utility weights compared to non-industry-sponsored studies.
