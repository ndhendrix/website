I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Washington's [Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute](https://sop.washington.edu/choice/). I previously earned my PharmD in 2015, also from the University of Washington.

My research interests are in health economics, pharmacoepidemiology, and the application of artificial intelligence to healthcare.
