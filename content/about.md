I'm a health economist and postdoctoral research fellow at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) where I study cost-effectiveness methodology under the supervision of [St√©phane Verguet](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/stephane-verguet/). 

Previously, I earned my PhD from the University of Washington's [Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute](https://sop.washington.edu/choice/) in 2020 and my PharmD in 2015, also from the University of Washington.

My research interests are health economics, pharmacoepidemiology, and the application of artificial intelligence to healthcare. My research in artificial intelligence is in three main areas: using conjoint analysis to study stakeholder attitudes towards clinical artificial intelligence; leveraging simulation methods to inform the clinical translation of artificial intelligence-based risk scores in cancer screening; and developing methodologies for performing cost-effectiveness analysis on artificial intelligence-based clinical tools.
