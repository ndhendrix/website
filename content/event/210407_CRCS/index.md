abstract: The increasing number of artificial intelligence-based tools approved for use in clinical settings has made translational research on this topic urgently necessary. Methods in cost-effectiveness analysis have been developed to promote equitable decision-making around many health technologies, and further methodological work is under way to ensure that these methods are well-suited to clinical AI. I will discuss equity-centered cost-effectiveness methodologies and the data that health economists need from AI research to perform these analyses on AI-based tools.
