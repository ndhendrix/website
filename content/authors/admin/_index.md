I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Global Health & Population at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health where I study with [St√©phane Verguet](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/stephane-verguet/). My research interests include integrating equity into cost-effectiveness analysis, personalizing cancer screening through risk-stratification, and using the tools of health economics to solve translational issues around clinical artificial intelligence.
