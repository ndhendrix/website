        <p>I’m a researcher and data scientist with the American Board of Family Medicine and their Center for Professionalism and Value in Health Care. 
	<p>My research focuses on natural language processing with clinical notes, epidemiology, and artificial intelligence for decision support.
	<p>Here are some questions that motivate me:
		<ul>
  			<li>How can we reduce the heterogeneity of diagnoses by different clinicians?</li>
  			<li>What would a healthcare system designed around AI look like?</li>
			<li>How can we model the diffusion of novel practice patterns among clinicians?</li>
			<li>How can we accelerate the integration of new scientific knowledge into clinical decisions?</li>
  			<li>To what extent can we automate the process of learning from observational data (EHR and claims, yes, but also behavioral data from phones and other ambient sensors)?</li>
			<li>How would our world change if we substantially lengthened our lifespans?</li>
		</ul>
